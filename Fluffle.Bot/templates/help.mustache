I am a bot that can reverse search furry art\. I'll try to find the sources of any images you throw at me\! I can also help out in channels and groups chats, check out Fluffle its [bot documentation](https://fluffle.xyz/bot/) if you are interested in that\.

*Configuration*
[The website](http://fluffle.xyz/bot/#configuration) contains examples and more details about how you can configure the bot\.

/setformat \- Set if sources should be presented using text/captions or the inline keyboard\.
/settextformat \- Set if text should be formatted the compact or expanded way\.
/settextseparator \- Configure the bot to use a separator character of your liking\. Applied when using the platform names text format\.

*Rate limits*
The bot makes use of rate limiting and prioritization to prevent abuse and guarantee service consistently to everyone\. Per chat, per 24\-hour period, a chat is allowed to make 400 reverse search requests\. Exceed this, and the bot will start ignoring any images sent\.

*Miscellaneous*
/ihasfoundbug \- Found a bug? Get information on how to report it\.
